        <h1>A Brief About John Ansa</h1>
        <div class="w-100">
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my personal blog on programming and software
            development! My name is John Ansa and I have been a full stack
            developer for over 5 years, working mainly with .NET technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a software developer, I have always had a passion for technology
            and its potential to improve the world we live in. Over the years, I
            have honed my skills and gained a wealth of knowledge in various
            areas of software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this blog to share my experience and knowledge with others
            who are passionate about programming and software development.
            Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I believe
            that there is always something new to learn and share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my blog, I aim to provide valuable insights and tutorials on
            a variety of topics, including .NET development, full stack
            development, and the latest trends in software development. I also
            plan to write about

              >my personal projects</a
            >
            and experiences as a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to help you grow as a developer and to provide you with
            the resources and support you need to succeed in the industry.
            Whether you're just starting out or looking to enhance your skills,
            I believe that with the right guidance and a growth mindset,
            anything is possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. I hope you find it
            informative and enjoyable.
