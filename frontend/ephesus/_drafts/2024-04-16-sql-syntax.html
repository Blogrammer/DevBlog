  Structured Query Language (SQL) is the backbone of relational database management systems (RDBMS), enabling users to interact with databases
  effectively. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;SQL syntax consists of keywords with a unique set of rules for writing SQL statements. Understanding SQL syntax is crucial for anyone working
  with databases, whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your journey in data management.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In this beginner’s guide, we’ll list all the SQL syntax and their usage in constructing queries effectively.</p>
<br />

<h2>Understanding SQL Queries</h2>
<p>
  At its core, SQL is a language used to communicate with databases. It allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in a relational
  database management system (RDBMS). The primary operation in SQL is the query, which is a request for specific information from a database.

  <strong>Note:</strong> SQL keywords are case insensitive, which means <strong>SELECT </strong>and <strong>select </strong>have the same meaning in
  SQL statements.&nbsp;
</p>
<br />
<h2>Basic SQL Syntax</h2>
<br />
<h3>SELECT</h3>
<p>
  The <code>SELECT</code> statement stands as one of the most fundamental keywords in SQL. It allows users to retrieve data from one or more tables
  within a database. It follows this basic structure:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
</code></pre>
<br />
<h6>For example:</h6>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees;
</code></pre>
<br />
<h3>WHERE&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
  The <code>WHERE</code> clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions. It is typically used in conjunction with the
  <code>SELECT </code>statement to retrieve only the rows that meet the specified criteria.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
</code></pre>
<br />
<h6>For example:</h6>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date &gt;= '2023-01-01';
</code></pre>
