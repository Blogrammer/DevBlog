<h5>Recovering from Transient Failures .NET Applications</h5>
<p>
  When developing applications, errors are inevitable. Whether it&#39;s a server outage, a database connection failure, or a timeout issue, errors can
  cause frustration for users and damage the reputation of your application.

  gracefully and improve the user experience is to implement retry logic in your C# code.
</p>
<p>In this guide, we&#39;ll explore what retry logic is, why it&#39;s important, and how to implement it effectively in your C# applications.</p>

<h2>What is Retry Logic?</h2>

<p>
  Retry logic is a technique used to automatically retry an operation that has failed, with the goal of eventually succeeding. When an error occurs,
  instead of giving up immediately, the application waits for a certain period of time, then tries again. This process continues until either the
  operation succeeds or a maximum number of retries is reached.

<h2>Why is Retry Logic Important?</h2>

<p>
  Implementing retry logic in your C# applications can help improve the user experience and increase the reliability and scalability of your
  application.
</p>
<p>Here are some of the key benefits of using retry logic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved user experience:</strong> Retry logic can help your application handle errors gracefully, providing a better user experience
      for your customers. Instead of seeing an error message, they can simply wait a few seconds and try again.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Increased reliability:</strong> Retry logic can help ensure that critical operations, such as database writes, are completed
      successfully. By retrying the operation if it fails, you can increase the overall reliability of your application.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Scalability:</strong> Retry logic can help your application handle high loads and spikes in traffic. By retrying requests that failed
      due to temporary issues, you can reduce the number of failed requests and improve the overall scalability of your application.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you understand the benefits of retry logic, let&#39;s explore how to implement it in your C# applications. Here are the steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Identify the Operation to Retry</h3>

<p>
  The first step in implementing retry logic is to identify the operation that needs to be retried. This could be a database write, a network request,
  or any other operation that may fail due to temporary issues.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Define the Retry Parameters</h3>

<p>
  Once you&#39;ve identified the operation to retry, you need to define the retry parameters. This includes the maximum number of retries, the delay
  between retries, and any additional parameters that are needed.
</p>
<h3>Step 3: Implement the Retry Logic</h3>

<p>
  With the retry parameters defined, you can now implement the retry logic. This involves wrapping the operation in a try-catch block, and then
  retrying the operation if an exception is caught. Here are some example of retry pattern in C# to get you started:

                action(); // Perform the operation here

            }

<h3>Step 4: Test and Refine the Retry Logic</h3>

<p>
  Once you&#39;ve implemented the retry logic, it&#39;s important to test it thoroughly and refine it as needed. Make sure to test the retry logic
  under different scenarios, such as high loads and network outages, to ensure that it works as expected. If you encounter any issues, refine the
  retry parameters or the implementation itself to improve its effectiveness.
</p>
<pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-cs match-braces">

public class Program
{
public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
Console.WriteLine("App Started");

        await RetryAsync(3);

        Console.WriteLine("App Completed");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    public static async Task RetryAsync(int maxRetries)
    {

        for (var i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++)
        {
            try
            {
                await DoSomethingAsync();
                break;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Failed {i + 1}: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
    public static async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        //Processing something cool
        await Task.Delay(500);
        //Throwing Exception so that retry will work
        throw new Exception("Exception Occurred while Processing...");
    }

}

//Output:
/**
App Started
Failed 1: Exception Occurred while Processing...
Failed 2: Exception Occurred while Processing...
Failed 3: Exception Occurred while Processing...
App Completed
**/
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 5: Monitor and Log Retries</h3>

<p>
  Finally, it&#39;s important to monitor and log retries in your application. This can help you identify issues and refine the retry logic over time.
  You can use your application&#39;s
  <a href="https://serilog.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logging framework</a>
  to log retry attempts, along with any relevant information such as the operation that was retried, the number of retries, and the delay between
  retries.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Implementing retry logic in your C# applications can help you handle errors gracefully, improve the user experience, and increase the reliability
  and scalability of your application. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can implement effective retry logic that will help your
  application recover from temporary issues and continue to provide value to your users.
</p>

<p>
  Remember to test and refine your retry logic over time, and to monitor retries to identify any issues that may arise. With these best practices in
  place, you can build resilient and scalable applications that meet the needs of your users.
