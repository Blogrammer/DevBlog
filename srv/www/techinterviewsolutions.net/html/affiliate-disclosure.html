                Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity
                of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we
                live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the
                universe.

                The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as
                we know it are everywhere, so there's no reason to think that
                Earth would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life
                became intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we
                find that.

                If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large
                enough and carry enough energy into our system to disrupt
                transportation, communication, the food chains, and that can be
                a really bad day on Earth.
