            "content_text": "  Docker is a powerful containerization platform that simplifies  application deployment and management. If you're running a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Debian as your operating system, this guide will walk  you through a step-by-step process on how to install Docker debian on your VPS.  Prerequisites to Install Docker on Debian VPSBefore you begin, ensure that you have:  A VPS running Debian 12.  A 64-bit System.  SSH access to your VPS with administrative privileges.  If you don't already have a VPS, sign up on Vultr and get  $100 of credit.Steps to Install Docker Debian Steps  &nbsp;Step 1: Update the SystemIt&#39;s essential to update your system packages.Login to your VPS from the terminal and run the command below to update your existing list of packages.sudo apt updateThis command is mostly run after a fresh system install or before installing a new software package.  The apt update command updates the local package index of a Linux system or package list,&nbsp;which is a database of available  packages and their versions. It does not actually install any updates; it only refreshes the information about available packages from the  repositories.&nbsp;Step 2: Upgrade the SystemNeed to upgrade your software packages to their latest versions? Then apt upgrade is the command to execute.sudo apt upgradeThe apt upgrade command, without any arguments, upgrades all outdated packages residing on your system to their latest versions.To list packages that are due for an upgrade, you run the&nbsp;apt list --upgradable command.&nbsp;Step 3: Reboot the SystemDepending on the packages you have installed. It&#39;s advisable to reboot the system.    rebootAfter the system reboots, you have to log back into your Debian VPS.&nbsp;Step 4: Install Required DependenciesDocker requires some dependencies to be installed. Install them using the following command:sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 software-properties-commonThese dependencies let apt use packages over HTTPS.&nbsp;Step 5: Add Docker RepositoryTo install Docker, you&#39;ll need to add the Docker repository to your system.Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpgAdd the Docker repository to APT sources:echo \"deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list&nbsp;Step 6: Update packagesUpdate the package index with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:sudo apt updateAfter updating the packages list you are now ready to install Docker Debian on your VPS.&nbsp;Step 7: Install Docker EngineNow, it&#39;s time to install Docker on your VPS:    sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.ioDocker Engine and CLI are now installed on your VPS running Debian.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 8: Start and Enable DockerTo ensure Docker starts automatically after system reboots:sudo systemctl enable dockersudo systemctl start docker&nbsp;Step 9: Verify Docker InstallationCheck if Docker is installed correctly by running the following command:sudo docker --versionYou should see the Docker version information displayed, confirming a successful installation.&nbsp;Step 10: Allow a Local User to Run Docker Command (Optional)  The&nbsp;docker&nbsp;command by default can only be run by the&nbsp;root&nbsp;user or by a user in  the&nbsp;docker&nbsp;group.  To allow a local user to run docker commands without prefixing it with&nbsp;sudo, add the user to the docker group using the&nbsp;usermod command:sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}&nbsp;Step 11: Run a Test ContainerLet&#39;s run a simple test container to verify Docker&#39;s functionality:sudo docker run hello-world  This command will pull a small test image and run it. If successful, you&#39;ll see a message indicating that your installation appears to be  working correctly.&nbsp;Conclusion  Congratulations!

            "content_text": "        Recovering from Transient Failures .NET Applications                  When developing applications, errors are inevitable. Whether it&#39;s          a server outage, a database connection failure, or a timeout issue,          errors can cause frustration for users and damage the reputation of          your application.                          One way to          handle transient errors          gracefully and improve the user experience is to implement retry logic          in your C# code.                          In this guide, we&#39;ll explore what retry logic is, why it&#39;s          important, and how to implement it effectively in your C#          applications.                What is Retry Logic?                  Retry logic is a technique used to automatically retry an operation          that has failed, with the goal of eventually succeeding. When an error          occurs, instead of giving up immediately, the application waits for a          certain period of time, then tries again. This process continues until          either the operation succeeds or a maximum number of retries is          reached.                                          &nbsp;        Why is Retry Logic Important?                  Implementing retry logic in your C# applications can help improve the          user experience and increase the reliability and scalability of your          application.                Here are some of the key benefits of using retry logic:                                            Improved user experience: Retry logic can help              your application handle errors gracefully, providing a better user              experience for your customers. Instead of seeing an error message,              they can simply wait a few seconds and try again.                                                          Increased reliability: Retry logic can help              ensure that critical operations, such as database writes, are              completed successfully. By retrying the operation if it fails, you              can increase the overall reliability of your application.                                                          Scalability: Retry logic can help your              application handle high loads and spikes in traffic. By retrying              requests that failed due to temporary issues, you can reduce the              number of failed requests and improve the overall scalability of              your application.                                      How to Implement Retry Logic in C#                                        Image Credit:            c-sharpcorner.com                                    Now that you understand the benefits of retry logic, let&#39;s explore          how to implement it in your C# applications. Here are the steps:                Step 1: Identify the Operation to Retry                  The first step in implementing retry logic is to identify the          operation that needs to be retried. This could be a database write, a          network request, or any other operation that may fail due to temporary          issues.                Step 2: Define the Retry Parameters                  Once you&#39;ve identified the operation to retry, you need to define          the retry parameters. This includes the maximum number of retries, the          delay between retries, and any additional parameters that are needed.                Step 3: Implement the Retry Logic                  With the retry parameters defined, you can now implement the retry          logic. This involves wrapping the operation in a try-catch block, and          then retrying the operation if an exception is caught. Here are some          example of retry pattern in C# to get you started:                Retry Logic with Waiting Time                        public static void WaitAndRetry(Action action, int maxRetries, TimeSpan retryInterval)    {        var retryCount = 0;        while (retryCount = maxRetries)                {                    throw new Exception($\"Getting Exception : {ex.Message} after {retryCount} retries.\", ex);                }                // Wait for a certain period of time before retrying                Thread.Sleep(retryInterval);            }        }    }                      &nbsp;        Retry Logic without Waiting Time         public static void Retry(Action action, int maxRetries){    var retryCount = 0;    while (true)    {        try        {            action();            return;        }        catch when (retryCount         &nbsp;        Retry Logic with Waiting Time and Return Type         public static T WaitAndRetry&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; func, int maxRetries, TimeSpan retryInterval){    var retryCount = 0;    while (retryCount = maxRetries)            {                throw new Exception($\"Getting Exception : {ex.Message} after {retryCount} retries.\", ex);            }            // Wait for a certain period of time before retrying            Thread.Sleep(retryInterval);        }    }    return func();}&nbsp;Retry Logic without Waiting Time and Return Typepublic static T Retry&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;T&gt; func, int maxRetries){var retryCount = 0;while (true){try{return func();}catch when (retryCount         &nbsp;         Asynchronous Retry Logic without Waiting Time         public static async Task RetryAsync(Func&lt;Task&gt; func, int maxRetries){    for (var i = 0; i &nbsp; Asynchronous Retry Logic with Waiting Timepublic static async Task WaitAndRetryAsync(Func&lt;Task&gt; func, int maxRetries, TimeSpan retryInterval){for (var i = 0; i         &nbsp;                  Asynchronous Retry Logic without Waiting Time and Return            Type                 public static async Task&lt;T&gt; RetryAsync&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; func, int maxRetries){    for (var i = 0; i         &nbsp;                  Asynchronous Retry Logic with Waiting Time and Return Type                 public static async Task&lt;T&gt; WaitAndRetryAsync&lt;T&gt;(Func&lt;Task&lt;T&gt;&gt; func, int maxRetries, TimeSpan retryInterval){    for (var i = 0; i         Step 4: Test and Refine the Retry Logic                  Once you&#39;ve implemented the retry logic, it&#39;s important to          test it thoroughly and refine it as needed. Make sure to test the          retry logic under different scenarios, such as high loads and network          outages, to ensure that it works as expected. If you encounter any          issues, refine the retry parameters or the implementation itself to          improve its effectiveness.                        public class Program{public static async Task Main(string[] args){Console.WriteLine(\"App Started\");        await RetryAsync(3);        Console.WriteLine(\"App Completed\");        Console.ReadKey();    }    public static async Task RetryAsync(int maxRetries)    {        for (var i = 0; i Step 5: Monitor and Log Retries                  Finally, it&#39;s important to monitor and log retries in your          application. This can help you identify issues and refine the retry          logic over time. You can use your application&#39;s          logging framework          to log retry attempts, along with any relevant information such as the          operation that was retried, the number of retries, and the delay          between retries.                Conclusion                  Implementing retry logic in your C# applications can help you handle          errors gracefully, improve the user experience, and increase the          reliability and scalability of your application. By following the          steps outlined in this guide, you can implement effective retry logic          that will help your application recover from temporary issues and          continue to provide value to your users.                          Remember to test and refine your retry logic over time, and to monitor          retries to identify any issues that may arise. With these best          practices in place, you can build resilient and scalable applications          that meet the needs of your users.        ",

This could be a database write, a          network request, or any other operation that may fail due to temporary          issues.        </p>        <h3>Step 2: Define the Retry Parameters</h3>        <p>          Once you&#39;ve identified the operation to retry, you need to define          the retry parameters. This includes the maximum number of retries, the          delay between retries, and any additional parameters that are needed.        </p>        <h3>Step 3: Implement the Retry Logic</h3>        <p>          With the retry parameters defined, you can now implement the retry          logic. This involves wrapping the operation in a try-catch block, and          then retrying the operation if an exception is caught.

            "content_text": "How to Use Custom Element Data for Improved Functionality  HTML5 data attributes  allow developers to add custom data to HTML elements. Data attributes are extremely useful for storing extra information about an element that  isn&#39;t appropriate to store in any other HTML attribute. This additional data can then be used by JavaScript to manipulate the element or perform  other actions.In this blog post, we&#39;ll explore how to use HTML5 data attributes with JavaScript.What are HTML5 data attributes?  Data attributes are HTML attributes that start with the prefix  data-. The value of a data attribute can be any valid string and can be set to any element in the HTML document.  For example, let&#39;s say we have an HTML element with the class name  user:        &lt;div class=\"user\"&gt;John Ansa&lt;/div&gt;We can add a custom data attribute called id to this element by using the data- prefix:        &lt;div class=\"user\" data-id=\"123\"&gt;John Ansa&lt;/div&gt;  In this example, we&#39;ve added a custom  data-id attribute to the div element, with a value of 123.How to access data attributes with JavaScript  To access data attributes with JavaScript, we can use the  getAttribute() method on the element. For example, let&#39;s say we want to get the value of the data-id attribute for the  div element above. We can do this using the following JavaScript code:        const userElement = document.querySelector('.user');        const userId = userElement.getAttribute('data-id');        // Line 2 can also be written as below:        // const userId = userElement.dataset.id;        console.log(userId); // Output: \"123\"  In this example, we first select the div element with the class name user using the querySelector() method.  We then use the getAttribute() method to get the value of the data-id attribute for the selected element and assign it to  the userId variable.How to set data attributes with JavaScript  To set data attributes with JavaScript, we can use the  setAttribute() method on the element. For example, let&#39;s say we want to change the value of the data-id attribute for  the div element above to 456. We can do this using the following JavaScript code:        const userElement = document.querySelector('.user');        userElement.setAttribute('data-id', '456');  In this example, we first select the div element with the class name user using the querySelector() method.  We then use the setAttribute() method to set the value of the data-id attribute for the selected element to  456.How to use data attributes in JavaScript event listeners  Data attributes can be extremely useful when working with JavaScript event listeners. Let&#39;s say we want to attach a click event listener to the  div element above, and we want to perform a different action depending on the value of the data-id attribute.We can do this using the following JavaScript code:        const userElement = document.querySelector('.user');        userElement.addEventListener('click', function() {          const userId = this.getAttribute('data-id');          if (userId === '123') {            console.log('Clicked on John Ansa');          } else if (userId === '456') {            console.log('Clicked on Jane Doe');          } else {            console.log('Clicked on an unknown user');          }        });  In this example, we attach a click event listener to the  div element with the class name user using the addEventListener() method. We then use the  getAttribute() method to get the value of the data-id attribute for the selected element, and assign it to the  userId variable.  Finally, we use a conditional statement to check the value of  userId and perform a different action based on that value.Conclusion  HTML5 data attributes are a powerful and easy-to-use feature that allows developers to add  custom data to HTML elements. With JavaScript, we can easily access and manipulate these data attributes to perform various actions on the elements.  Data attributes can be used in many ways, such as to store additional information about an element, to perform conditional actions based on the  value of the attribute, or to attach data to an element that can be accessed later in the application.  In this blog post, we&#39;ve explored some of the basics of using HTML5 data attributes with JavaScript. By using the  getAttribute() and setAttribute() methods, you can easily access and modify data attributes for any HTML element. And by  using data attributes in conjunction with  JavaScript event listeners, you can create more sophisticated and interactive web applications that provide a better user experience for your users.Overall, HTML5 data attributes are a valuable tool in a developer&#39;s toolbox and should be considered when working with JavaScript and HTML.",

Image Credit:    blog.ssdnodes.com        Accessing the Command Line    The first step in using the Linux command line is to access it. This is typically done through a terminal emulator program, which can be found in  the applications menu of your operating system.      Navigating the File System  The Linux file system is organized into a hierarchical structure, with the root directory at the top and subdirectories branching off from it.  To navigate the file system, you&rsquo;ll use the &ldquo;cd&rdquo; (change directory) command. For example, if you want to move from your home  directory to the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:              cd Documents                Listing the Contents of a Directory  To see the contents of a directory, you can use the &ldquo;ls&rdquo; (list) command. For example, if you want to see the contents of the  &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    ls Documents  Displaying the Current DirectoryTo see the full path of the current working directory, you can use the &ldquo;pwd&rdquo; (print working directory) command. For example:    pwd  &nbsp;Copying Files  The &ldquo;cp&rdquo; (copy) command is used to copy files from one location to another. For example, if you want to copy the file  &ldquo;file.txt&rdquo; from the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory to the &ldquo;Downloads&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    cp Documents/file.txt Downloads/  &nbsp;Moving or Renaming Files  The &ldquo;mv&rdquo; (move) command is used to move or rename files. For example, if you want to rename the file &ldquo;file.txt&rdquo; in the  &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory to &ldquo;newfile.txt&rdquo;, you would use the following command:    mv Documents/file.txt Documents/newfile.txt      Deleting Files&nbsp;  The &ldquo;rm&rdquo; (remove) command is used to remove (delete) files. For example, if you want to delete the file &ldquo;newfile.txt&rdquo; in the  &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    rm Documents/newfile.txt      Creating Directories&nbsp;  The &ldquo;mkdir&rdquo; (make directory) command is used to create a new directory. For example, if you want to create a new directory called  &ldquo;newdir&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    mkdir Documents/newdir      Deleting Directories&nbsp;  The &ldquo;rmdir&rdquo; (remove directory) command is used to remove (delete) an empty directory. For example, if you want to delete the directory  &ldquo;newdir&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    rmdir Documents/newdir      Viewing File Content&nbsp;  The &ldquo;cat&rdquo; (concatenate) command is used to display the contents of a file. For example, if you want to see the contents of the file  &ldquo;newfile.txt&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    cat Documents/newfile.txt  Creating Empty Files&nbsp;  The &ldquo;touch&rdquo; command is used to create a new empty file. For example, if you want to create a new empty file called  &ldquo;newfile.txt&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; directory, you would use the following command:    touch Documents/newfile.txt    Conclusion  This tutorial has provided an introduction to the Linux command line and covered some of the most commonly used commands.
